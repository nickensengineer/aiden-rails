# README for Project Aiden

The Aiden application is a WIP of a project management application that is geared toward care givers, care teams, and professionals who service and interact with behavioral, mental, and memory care patients and people. 

The starting inspiration for this project is Basecamp by 37 Signals. The primary functionality necessary in this app focuses on empowering care givers a platform to collaborate, communicate, and retain important information, scheduling, decision making, and task/effort tracking. The short term goal for the project is for webapp functionality, then native mobile deployment, then native desktop deployment to Windows, macOS, and Linux. Once native mobile and desktop deployments are achieved, the next goal with be OS/platform integrations. 

The Aiden application aims to always be 100% cloud native and 100% HIPPA compliant. 

## The Aiden project is commited to being person-first, 100% inclusive, and 100% accessible. 

## If you would like to contribute to the project or would like to participate or leverage the project in your care team or care giving setting, please do not hesitate to contact the development team.
